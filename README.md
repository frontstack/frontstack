# FrontStack

Self-contained, portable and ready-to-run GNU/Linux software stack for modern web development

## About

FrontStack aims to provide a complete development environment for 
modern web development based on a software stack powered by Node.js, Ruby and Python

Forget about development environments, just code!

## Features

- GNU/Linux
- 64 bits (yes! we're in 2014, it's time to switch)
- Multiplatform (using VirtualBox and Vagrant)
- Fully self-contained without OS-level shared libraries dependencies
- Great isolation from the OS
- Configurable from an `ini` file
- Support for package provisioning
- Easy to install and use
- Easy to use from CI and deployment environments
- Support for software stack updates

## Why FrontStack?

- GNU/Linux is a consistent and reliable UNIX-like OS
- Fully portable (runs in any GNU/Linux distro)
- No OS configuration setup or specific requirements
- Virtualization today is lightweight, do not fear it!
- Unique environment: reproducible, consistent, reliable
- Avoid provide support or maintain multiple platforms or dev environments
- Most CI servers runs GNU/Linux, provide the same environment to the end developers

## Installation
 
### Virtualized

You can easily run FrontStack in any OS using VirtualBox and Vagrant

1. Download [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for your OS (64 bits)

2. Download FrontStack for virtual installations

  Run the intallation script
  ```
  $ curl -s https://raw.github.com/frontstack/frontstack/master/install.sh | bash
  ```

  If are an unlucky guy and you are running Windows, you should do all the installation stuff manually. 

  Click [here](https://github.com/frontstack/vagrant/archive/master.zip) to download the latest version.
  Then unzip it and simply follow the [README](https://github.com/frontstack/vagrant/blob/master/README.md) instructions.

3. Customize `Vagrantfile` and `setup.ini` (optionally)

4. From the `Vagrantfile` directory, run: 
  
  ```
  $ vagrant up 
  ```

  and if all goes fine, run:
  ```
  $ vagrant ssh
  ```

### Manual installation for GNU/Linux

1. Download the tarball
```
$ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/frontstack/files/latest/download -O frontstack-latest.tar.gz
```

2. Then install it in a custom path
```
$ mkdir ~/frontstack/ && tar xvfz frontstack-latest.tar.gz -C ~/fronstack
```

3. Use the environment specific bash session
```
$ cd ~/frontstack && ./bash.sh
```

If you want to load the environment variables on each bash session, add in your `~/.bash_profile` the following line:

```shell
[Â -f ~/fronstack/scripts/setenv.sh ] && . ~/fronstack/scripts/setenv.sh
```

##### Possible virtualization troubles

If you have some Virtualbox problems while trying to boot the VM and get a message like 
`processor architecture is not 64 bits` and you are sure your processor it is, you should 
try to enable the VT-x/AMD virtualization technology from your BIOS.

## Update 

You can easily upgrade the whole FrontStack environment simply running the following script:

```shell
$  ~/scripts/update.sh
```

Note that all files and directories will be overwritten, except the `packages/` directory.

You probably will need to instal Node or Ruby packages via it's own package manager, right? And what happens if I do an upgrade?
All the Node packages or Ruby gems you install during your development will be installed at the `packages/` directory and this will be ignored by the update process, so all the packages will remain after updates.
